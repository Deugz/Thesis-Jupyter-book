# Introduction

## 1.1 The Dust cycle in the Galaxy

- Different environment of the ISM
- Dust in ISM + gas H2 formation

The human eye is sensible to the visible part of the electromagnetic spectrum (400-800nm) allowing for  observation of Stars in our galaxy, but the InterStellar Medium (ISM) is made of a rich variaty in environments, all made of two key ingredients, Gas and Dust.
Dust form in the outer shells of stars and supernovae and are dispersed into the diffuse ISM. 
ISM various environment Molecular clouds where grains are shielded from radiation, form seeds for ice to form Ice formation processes, atomic deposition and water formation, desorption and readsorption (during early stage of stage formation) .
Complex Organic Molecules (COMs) in Molecular clouds (link with molecular diversity in planetary systems, comets - asteroids)
Chemistry within the ice  Different chemical processes (Rachel diagram)
Lab astronomy to mimic those processes  Amorphous Solid Water review
Challenges with ASW  Porosity, gas adsorption versus small angle neutron scattering
	Ice is very important but complex and still poorly understood
